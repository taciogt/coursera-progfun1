# Initial Setup 

What you have to get running in your machine before start playing with Scala:
* Oracle JDK (Java Development Kit) version 1.8;
* Scala Build Tool (sbt) version 0.13.x


## Oracle JDK

* Mac OS X

Quoting the course's own guide: 
> "Mac OS X either comes with a pre-installed JDK, or installs it automatically."
You can check if you have the right version by executing this command in the terminal:

```
$ java -version
```

## Installing SBT

Follow the sbt's [official installation guide](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html)
